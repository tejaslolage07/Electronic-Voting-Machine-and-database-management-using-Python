# Electronic-Voting-Machine-and-database-management-using-Python
This is a group project done by me and my friends as a part of the CS101 introduction to programming course
The voting system is implemented in the user terminal and database management is done using basic python file handling. As this was a very basic project meant to work solely with python, we did not implement any encryption for the database files.
